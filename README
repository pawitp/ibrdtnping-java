This is an simple implementation of "ping" using the IBR-DTN Java binding,
and was only intended to be a practice and an example of the simplest
usage of the binding.

By default, this program sends "DTNPING" to the localhost echo endpoint and
reads the reply.

The Java binding is available at https://github.com/ibrdtn/ibrdtn/tree/master/java/ibrdtnlib
